      ðŸ¥ž Nxtp is made up of a simple contract that uses a locking pattern to prepare
      and fulfill transactions, a network of offchain routers that participate in
      pricing auctions and pass calldata between chains, and a user-side sdk that
      finds routes and prompts onchain transactions.
